# Lab 07 nodeJS and npm express

**Author**: Rhiannon Mortensen Benjamin Hurst
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
In our project, we edited the article.insertRecord prototype to be able to render and load the user's input from new.html to index.html via a push of the new data into local storage.

## Getting Started
Steps a user must take in order to get this up and running on their own machine:
1 - clone the project down onto your local device (fork then clone if you are wanting to make your own edits)
2 - be sure to cd yourself into our file (ben-rhiannon)
3 - make sure before anything that you have node installed, as well as express, and run your npm server (using the command npm start)
4 - open new.html and create your own article and check it out on index.html!

## Architecture
CSS3 , HTML , JavaScript , jQuery , Handlebars , and AJAX

## Change Log

04-18-2018 11.35pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
Google, and our many helpful TA's and instructional staff :]
